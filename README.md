# Kitchen-Stock-Manager
This program was written in C with my partner in the course Intro to Coding Systems.
The code had to do the following functions:
1) Creating a dish in the kitchen menue
2) Adding stock to an existing dish
3) Ordering dishes to a table
4) Canceling a dish
5) Closing a table (bill)
